# The Heterogeneity of Chinese Youth Depression Scales

This project aimed at revealing the heterogeneity of scales that used for measuring depression among children and adolescents in China. Its was inspired by [Fried (2017)](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016503271631312X), which revealed the heterogeneity of seven widely used depression scales used in Western countries. The project involved literature search, article screening, data extraction, data analysis, and report writing. The main steps and folder structure of the project are described below.

## Main findings
Our content analysis identified 84 unique symptoms across the 27 scales and low rate of overlap (mean = 0.19, range: 0.09–0.25), suggesting that instruments often assumed to becomparable capture distinct symptom domains.
