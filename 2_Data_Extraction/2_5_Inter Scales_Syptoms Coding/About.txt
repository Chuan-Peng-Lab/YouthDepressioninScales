4_2_5_0_Zero Trial
	在task5中，已经确定了哪些症状可以合并，我们的症状总数有所减少
	确定好了所有量表的题目所应该对应的新症状（合并后的症状）
	6-0由5-1整理得到
        In Task 5, the symptoms that could be merged were identified, leading to a reduced total number of symptoms. 
        This stage finalized the mapping of each questionnaire item to its new      
        (merged) symptom. The file 6-0 was compiled based on 5-1.
4_2_5_1_First Trial
	四个人各自对每一个题目所在症状，是特殊症状还是复合症状进行编码
	确定了哪些是特殊症状，哪些是复合症状后，所以接下来只需要将对应的题目编码为1或2即可
	如果一个量表中存在某复合症状，则该量表该题目被编码为2，其余下的特殊症状被编码为1
        Each of the four researchers independently coded the symptoms corresponding to each item,
        classifying them as either specific symptoms or compound symptoms.
        After these classifications were finalized, each item was coded as 1 or 2: items belonging to compound symptoms were coded as 2,
        and those belonging to specific symptoms were coded as 1.
