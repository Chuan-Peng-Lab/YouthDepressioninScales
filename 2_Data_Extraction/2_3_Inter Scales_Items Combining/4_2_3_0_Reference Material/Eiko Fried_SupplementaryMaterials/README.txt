The Supplementary Materials contain 5 files. 

(1) "Symptom table.xlsx" 
This is the result of the content analysis and provides an overview about which items occur in which scales.

(2) "Analysis.r"
This is the R file containing syntax to run the analyses and produce the Figure. 

(3) "MatrixA.csv"
The data to produce Figure 1; this is Matrix A from the "Symptom table.xlsx" file. It is provided here as extra file for simplicity. 

(4) "MatrixB.csv"
The data to estimate the Jaccard coefficients; this is Matrix B from the "Symptom table.xlsx" file. It is provided here as extra file for simplicity.

(5) "Convergent Validity.r"
This is the R file to estimate convergent validity among scales, adjusting (a) scale length and (b) inter-item correlation, as discussed in the Discussion section of the manuscript.
