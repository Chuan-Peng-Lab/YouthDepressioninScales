重新对2_2Inner Scales_Items Combining进行double check，检查之前所做有没有不合理的地方
A double-check (DC) of 2_2 Inner Scales_Items Combining to verify and correct any potentially 
inconsistent or unreasonable merging decisions made in the earlier step.
OUTPUT
	包含了各个成员分开的结果以及最终讨论后的结果
        Contains the individual results from each team member as well as the final version agreed upon after group discussion. 
Depression_Raw_Data7(ISIC_DC)
	Inner Scales_Items Combining_Double Check
	之后，再转化为最终由Liuqing对矩阵进行double check
	得到Depression_Symptom_MatrixA_DC，之后将以此画图
        Produced after the Inner Scales_Items Combining Double Check. 
        The resulting matrix was then double-checked by Liuqing, generating Depression_Symptom_MatrixA_DC, 
        which served as the basis for subsequent visualization.
